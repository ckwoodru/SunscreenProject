### Sunscreen Project

This project is presented by Chelsea Woodruff as the data and analysis side of her masters thesis project titled: An Assessment of Willingness to Pay for Coral-Safe Sunscreens.

The data is from 348 respondents via survey from Qualtrics (survey creation website) which ask questions about the consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) for coral-safe sunscreen, and some Likert-scale questions to assess their environmental behaviors and attitudes.

Here are the files pertinent to the project:

### 1. RawDatafromQualtrics: 
This is a csv file containing the non-transformed data values of the respondents as initially downloaded from Qualtrics. Transforming the values must occur to work with the data for analysis purposes.

### 2. InitialDataProcessing: 
These is how we turn the Likert-scale questions into values 1-7 and turn tiers of Education and Income levels, etc. (from the Demographics) into numerical values or LOW, MODERATE, HIGH expressions. 

### 3. Data Analysis: 
We begin to create models to examine interactions between the variables. In addition, examining boxplots to better understand the results. We end by running an anova of the resluting model.
