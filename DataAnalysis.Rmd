```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

To analyze the relationship that the demographics may have had with the maximum  price the respondent was willing to pay, we need to create a linear model including all variables:
```{r}

mymodel <- lm(Q2 ~ Education + Gender + Income + Age + HumanInterference + EquityDevelopment + HumansOverNature + DutiesNonhumans, data = myData_sub)

summary(mymodel)

```

We can do an AIC stepwise analysis too:
```{r}
mymod2 <- step(mymodel, scope = ~.^2)

summary(mymod2)
```
11% of variation is explained through regression line
```{r}
boxplot(Q2 ~ Income, data = myData_sub)
boxplot(Q2 ~ Education, data = myData_sub)
plot(Q2 ~ Age, data = myData_sub) 
```

We also want to see the results of an anova analysis to examine interaction:
```{r}
anova(mymod2)
```
